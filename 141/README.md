# A `M-x` (`execute-extended-command`) for `XMonad`

**Xmonad** is great. But, we do love some **rofi-like** applications. We like to type and find a command, which we either don't have or don't remember the bindings for that program in our WM.

So, just like **Emacs**, which we have the all-powerful all-knowing `M-x`, a.k.a, `execute-extended-command`. It would also be fireworks if we had a similar functionality for DE/WMs.

In Xmonad, we would start by typing the bindings, and a list of possibilities would unfold to "refresh our memories".
