# The Bibi Files (2024) [DOC]

Benjamin Mileikowsky

``` 
Listen to me. The Prime Minister is the most principled and honest person in the world. My husband is the strongest Prime Minister we've ever had. He protects our country, saves our country. This country has never had it better. He is an admired leader around the world.

In three days, we will be at the White House, where he'll be welcomed like a king.

All over the world leaders and the general public admire him.

When he walks the streets of New York or Australia, people stand around and applaud.

He's simply an admired leader around the world, who does great things for the State of Israel.
```
-- Sara Mileikowsky, while being interrogated on fraudulent activities.


## Corruption cases

### Cabinet positions in exchange for favour/money/gifts

### Exchange payments for a trip etc, for power and legal facilitation

### Arnon Milchan - Tycoon (very wealthy and powerful business person)

Hollywood producer, billionaire etc.

Bragged about being a "James Bond", in real life (working for Israel's interest, in USA). He gets his VISA revoked. Then, Mileikowsky intervene directly, making calls to the USA embassy, asking to reinstate Arnon's VISA.

### Sheldon and Mirian Adelson

### The hot tape

### Shaul Elovitch - Tycoon

Enriched itself with doing almost nothing (importing and selling nokia cellphones among other irrelevant things).

He also is owner of Walla. Online zionist news outlet. Very popular among youngsters (similar to Jovem Pan, in Brazil). 

Shaul Elovitch exchanged favours with Mileikowsky, so he would be covered always in a good lighting, in the Walla journal.

### Nir Hefetz (Manager for the Mileikowsky family)

Nir Hefetz became of the main informants of all this investigation.

He mediated most of the interactions between Shaul Elovitch and Mileikowsky.

**Quid pro quo**:  In the end it was a 250$ million dollar signature from Mileikowsky, in exchange for control of Walla.

### Ilan Yeshua (subtituted, more right-wing General Manager of Walla)

Gives out the evidence of the **Quid pro Quo**.

### Itamar Ben-Gvir; Bezalel Smotrich

Mileikowsky turns to the right-wing extremism as allies, in order to avoid prison for his corruption case.

One of the ways the far-right represents itself, in Occupied Palestine - as in many other places - is as patriots. Anyone else, are leftists communists psychopats, baby eaters that want to destroy the country. Basically, that is the gist of the bi-polar retoric.

Extreme division. Divide and conquer style politics.

``` quote
My fellow members of Knesset, I want to stand here and say unequivocally: there is no such thing as the Palestinian people, period.

There is none. There was none. Period.

-- Bezalel Smotrich
```

### Ami Ayalon (Shin Bet)

``` quote
You just have to listen to Smotrich and Ben-Gvir. Smotrich is a Jewish terrorist.
```

``` quote
He (Smotrich) has all the instruments, in order to use it for a terror action. But, he kept silent. And, because we do not interrogate Jewish terrorists, the way we interrogate Palestinian terrorists, he did not confess.
And, this is why he was not in jail.

When it comes to Ben-Gvir, he supported the assassination of Prime Minister Rabin, when he was a youngster.
```

Rabin helped negociate a peace resolution with Palestine (that didn't last).

``` quote
I think one is justified to committing horrible acts against him (Prime Minister Rabin).
```
-- Ben-Gvir

Three weeks later, Rabin was assassinated.

### Paying up Hamas

Transfered money, through Qatar, to Hamas. Signed a document that he was requesting Qatar to do so. This was *before* the Hamas' advance in October.[^1][^2][^3][^4]

``` quote 
In the late 1970s and early 1980s, Israel provided indirect support to Islamic organizations in Gaza, including Mujama al-Islamiya, the precursor to Hamas. This support aimed to counterbalance the secular nationalist influence of the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO). Israeli authorities allowed and, in some cases, facilitated the activities of these Islamic groups, permitting the construction of mosques, schools, and social institutions. Brigadier General Yitzhak Segev, the Israeli military governor of Gaza during that period, acknowledged providing financial assistance to these organizations under Israeli directives.  
```
[^5][^6]

```
This strategy was intended to weaken the PLO's dominance but inadvertently contributed to the rise of Hamas as a significant political and militant force in the region. Over time, Hamas evolved into a militant organization committed to armed resistance against Israel, leading to increased tensions and conflict.
```
