# Software Requirements Specifications (SRS)

## Communication Bridge in SRS

- Users vs Developers.
- Users give _requirements_ and it's translated into _specifications_ for developers.
- _requirements_ have to do with tasks that must be accomplished by the application.
- _specifications_ are the outline of how a system can do, sufficiently, to meet the _requirements_.

## Non-functional requirements

Also known as `Design Constraints`.

- `CASE` systems: `Computer Assisted Software Engineering` tools

  Examples: _JIRA_, _Microsoft Project_, _Slack_ etc.

- Programming language.
- Development method.
- Quality-related constraints.

## Non-functional Classification: Product

- Requirement which specify a specific kind of behavior, from the product.

  > All necessary communication to the user must be expressed through standard ASCII character set.

## Non-functional Classification: Organizational

- Requirements which result from the organizational structure.
- Documents must follow a norm (ABNT, etc).
- Using or not `Scrum`.
- Code style (`linting`).
- etc.

## Non-functional Classification: External

- Requirements that arise from factors external to the system and it's
  development process.

  Example:

  > The system shall use a file format readable by MS-Word 6.0 and 2000.
  > Meet a certain coding-testing metrics.

## WRSPM Reference Model - The World Machine Model

It's a model to better translate the `Requirements` into `Specifications`.

- _Requirements_ are in `Problem Domain`.
- _Specifications_ are in the `Solution Domain`.
- Layers exist between them.

- W: World
- R: Requirements
- S: Specifications
- P: Program
- M: Machine

- $e_h$: `Elements hidden` from the system.
- $e_v$: `Elements visible` for the system (transfer parts from the $e_h$ that
  contain information).
- $s_v$: `System visible` mechanisms used by the user.
- $s_h$: `System hidden` what happens inside the computing system.
