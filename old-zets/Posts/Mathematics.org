<<Galileo's law of proportionality>>
.
One of the most peculiar relations I learned is that of Galileo's law of proportionality [1] [2]. That is hardly ever noted, or known by my peers. At the same time, this simple relation, when analyzed, the full disclosure of it's implications explains such a wide range of phenomena...
.
I was once asked by a dear high school teacher in Mathematics, by whom this relation I used to use so often, in my exams, was due to. I much latter have found the answer. At the time I said "Euler?", then he said "Well, seems like you will need to study some more...". 

This question was one that tormented me for some time... Finally, I took the time to dig into it, properly, and in it's history. Turns out, it's pretty interesting.

The generalized law goes as follows:
the ratio of a measure of dimension N is the N-th power of the ratio of a measure of dimension 1.
.
For example, the rate of change of the volume of a body can be inferred by the rate of change of a region's length, which require much more simple tools, i.e., rulers, to measure.
.
For an application, take the designing/architecture of a pyramid. If you have a small, modeled pyramid, made by the same materials the true one would be built, and you can test it's resistance and reliability. Then, to know the resistance of the greater one, in true size, all you would need is to use Galileo's law of proportionality, and Dimensional analysis on the formulas used to test the miniature one.
.
“And just lately I have succeeded in finding all the conclusions, with their proofs, pertaining to forces and resistances of pieces of wood of various lengths, sizes, and shapes, and by how much they would be weaker in the middle than at the ends, and how much more weight they can sustain if the weight were distributed over the whole rather than concentrated at one place, and what shape wood should have in order to be equally strong everywhere: which science is very necessary in making machines and all kinds of buildings, and which has never been treated before by anyone.”
--  Letter from Galileo to Antonio de’Medici in 1609.

This principle is used, nowadays, in biomechanics, to determine, and co-prove, the sizes, and forces acting in a body of an animal [3]. For example, by the maximum size a heart can be, what shall be the maximum size a giraffe can have. Then, you get the result it's exactly the size an actual giraffe is. That can be further used in evolution, and ecology studies; and, in fact, is [4].

One of the leading theories on biological and social grown is based on a analogy of metabolism, and a society as a organism [4][5]. So, you can measure the health and actual size of a region-society not by the number of individuals etc, but by it's "metabolism". This metabolism is measure, by it's turn, by "allometric measures" - that is, proportionality's law and dimensional analysis [4][5].
