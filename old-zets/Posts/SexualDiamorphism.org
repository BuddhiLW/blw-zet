BIOLOGY
First of three posts about <<Sexual Dimorphism>>.
THE <<Tournament Species>>.

Can you infer which one of these are the male, and females of the
species, shown in the photos? Can you infer their social and
individual behavior by physical differentiation?

Sexual dimorphism can be traced as one of most reliable characteristic
for inferring the =dynamics of social behavior= of a species.

The species with sexual dimorphism are called "Tournament Species".
That is, because there is a big difference physically between males
and females. And, there tends to be a very competitive behavior, in
societies, between males.

Tournament Species  are usually:
- Socially and parentally aggressive.
- Have strict differentiation of class in social functioning. Id est, females will do all the work for the upbringing of children.
- 95% of the reproduction is done by 5% of the males. Polygamous by unequal and highly differential power. 
- There is a high selection for traits that show "health" in males.
- High difference of longevity between male and females. Generally, males die quicker because of all the stress, high testosterone, physical struggle etc.
- No cheating, by females, because they will most likely loose all the work of the upbringing of the child.
