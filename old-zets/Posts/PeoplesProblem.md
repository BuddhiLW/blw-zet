It&rsquo;s said *divide and conquer* is one of the oldest tricks in the book.
Certainly, it haven&rsquo;t gone out of style.

For every class, or set, given that there are $n$ distinct elements, one can
form a huge number of possible partitions with them ([Known as Bell Numbers](https://wikiless.org/wiki/Bell_number?lang=en)).
Here is a short table mapping for each group formed of $n$ people, how many
partitions (subgroups) can be formed.

<table border="2" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="6" rules="groups" frame="hsides">


<colgroup>
<col  class="org-right" />

<col  class="org-right" />
</colgroup>
<thead>
<tr>
<th scope="col" class="org-right"><code>n</code> people</th>
<th scope="col" class="org-right">possible groups</th>
</tr>
</thead>

<tbody>
<tr>
<td class="org-right">0</td>
<td class="org-right">1</td>
</tr>


<tr>
<td class="org-right">1</td>
<td class="org-right">1</td>
</tr>


<tr>
<td class="org-right">2</td>
<td class="org-right">2</td>
</tr>


<tr>
<td class="org-right">3</td>
<td class="org-right">5</td>
</tr>


<tr>
<td class="org-right">4</td>
<td class="org-right">15</td>
</tr>


<tr>
<td class="org-right">5</td>
<td class="org-right">52</td>
</tr>


<tr>
<td class="org-right">6</td>
<td class="org-right">203</td>
</tr>


<tr>
<td class="org-right">7</td>
<td class="org-right">877</td>
</tr>


<tr>
<td class="org-right">8</td>
<td class="org-right">4140</td>
</tr>


<tr>
<td class="org-right">(&#x2026;)</td>
<td class="org-right">(&#x2026;)</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

Therefore, for the same group of people, let&rsquo;s say, **8** of them, you could form
**4140** possible subgroup-partition schemes! This concept is extremely important
to be grasped. Because, these numbers are so astronomical and they signal the
following: reasoning based on **group-partitioning** are essentially flawed, out
of any context.

Any opinion can be held about groups, once we can form an
astronomical quantity of them, and surely one of these possible partitioning
will fit our biased description of reality.

Finally, at least half (this proportion increases as the $n$ increases) of all
possible groupings are of **minority**-partitioning schemes.

## Historical examples of contraditions minority-schemes

In 03 February 2022, today, it&rsquo;s not outrageous to say that the
**LGBTQ+**-movement and the **Black**-movement are two of the greatest
**minority-based** movements there are. One, lead by group-thinking, might believe
that *clashes* or *frictions* between them to be exceptions. For, they both are
`minority` groups. Although, faced by the reality that, even when we deal with
small groups, there are no *possible* one, unifying, partition-rule that
characterize them. Therefore, all kinds of **unaccounted** behavior follow from
the great variate of subgroups possible in a group.

We know look at examples of **unaccounted** behaviors arising amongst minority
groups. Movements, itself, that appear antagonist and improbable, if we depart
from the minority-group hypothesis.
