- What are `Dockerfiles`? (221114120219-03)

  `Dockerfiles` structurally relate to bash-scripting building processes. In so
  far as a sequential processes to achieve a certain point-environment, in an
  image.

- What are the benefits of user `Dockerfiles`? (221114120717-03)

  As you can dynamically infer other building processes, as a starting point for
  your own, and furthermore, the `caching-problem` - of inattentively downloading
  packages which were not needed for the desired end-point-environment - is also
  resolved _as a bonus_.

- How `Dockerfiles` structure's work? (221114121739-03)

  There are keywords that will give full context for the scripting to take
  place. `FROM`, `LABEL`, `MAINTAINER`, `RUN`, `EXPOSE` and `ENV` are some of
  these, which are extremely descriptive.

  - `FROM`: Where the closest start-point, or the `parent` image, from where our
    image should start the building process.
  - `LABEL`: Refers to versioning-control. Important to have equally higher
    labels, as we increment our image. So, if something breaks, we can start
    from a closer-point image, which was a prior-labeled.
  - `MAINTAINER`: Who maintains the image, officially.
  - `RUN`: The instructions to script, on top of the `parent` image (`FROM`).
  - `EXPOSE`: Verbose meta-data about the image and it's resulting
    `environment`. Key to understand where everything should be running.
  - `ENV`: Variables that need to be exported and set, for the building process
    to work.

- What if I need to copy files to the virtual environment? (221114123719-03)

  Commands like `ADD` and `COPY` can be used interchangeably - the preferred
  verb is `ADD`. Because it a more robust alternative, which accepts more
  options.

- The commands that will be executed will have which _permissions_; `sudo`? (221114124105-03)

  If not specified, the user `user` will be default. But, `USER` key-word can be
  used to specify the `username` that will be in charge of issuing the `CMD`
  and/or `ENTRYPOINT` commands. These can take `-c` optional arguments to the
  `shell` commands.

- How to optimize the use of _image-layers_ and commands? (221114161939-03)

  Run commands as concatenated as possible. For example, for `RUN`, use the
  _short-circuit_ format, `&&`, to declare a sequence of commands - combined
  with `\` for readability.

- How to list the layers, from the build process? (221114170101-03)

  `docker image ls`, inside the `Dockerfile` directory.
  `docker run nmap`

## Examples

- How to execute `RUN` commands? (221114150735-03)

  There are two forms of execution that are accepted, `Shell form` or `Exec form`, which are `JSON` arrays.

  `Shell form`: ADD /my/local/file /build/directory
  `Shell form`: ENTRYPOINT /usr/bin/nmap -sn 172.17.0.0/24

  `Exec form`: ADD["/my/local/file", "/build/directory"]
  `Exec form`: ENTRYPOINT["/usr/bin/nmap", "-sn", "172.17.0.0/24"]

  OBS: `Exec form` are preferred, in relation to `Shell form`. Both because of
  standardization and lesser _undubius syntax_, as well as not-invoking the use
  of unnecessary _shell processes/sessions_.

- How to optimize the use of _image-layers_ and commands? (221114161958-03)

  Use `&&` combined with `\`.

  Example:

  ```dockerfile
  RUN yum --assumeyes update && \
      yum --assumeyes install bash nmap iproute && \
      yum clean all
  ```

- How to build and run images? (221114165658-03)

  `docker build -t <name>[:tag] /path/to/DockerFile-dir`

  Example, `docker build -t nmap .`; `docker run nmap`.
