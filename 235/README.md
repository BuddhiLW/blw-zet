# Personal Projects and why

## KEG (Knowledge Exchange Graph)

Things it can be useful for (current ideas):
- RAG source (LLMs);
- Transform into blog source (simply share it);
- Personal notes stored for later synthesis (self and LLMs; chatbots);
- Date-tracking of ideas (SO - Source of Origin; attribution);
- Point of comparison to self (Reflection source - time-indexed);
- How ideas connect (insight-tool);
- Extendable to other tools, in the age of LLMs.
