# A Command-line Interface (`CLI`) for translation

At last, there an easy and functionally-heavy `CLI` program - which also has 
the `GUI` counterpart - for translating among languages. And, it's `crow`!

It's as simple as:
```sh
crow -p -s pt -t zh-CN "Olá, mundo"
```
```sh
Olá, mundo

[ Portuguese -> Chinese (Simplified) ]

你好世界
/Nǐ hǎo shìjiè/
```

Great. Since today (20221204172318), I knew of an `Emacs` package that 
`bing-translated` Chinese to English. And, I used that on my studies of 
Mandarin. Now, I can also use vim. No need to spawn a browser and use google 
translate. I can do that through the terminal, furthermore, use other engines 
also. Perfect.

Thanks, Crow Team!
