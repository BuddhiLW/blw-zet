Salvador Dali is on point, and we can even name the /active procedure/ which
generates paranoiac thought and behavior. The destructive power of the digital
technologies, regarding disinformation and rage-inciting content, has been used
more than once. Generally, related to politics. But, this case is only the most
explicit one. Of course, this relates to power-dynamics war tactics. And,
power-dynamics exist not only in politics; thus, this hasn't been used only in
politics.
