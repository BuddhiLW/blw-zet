# Reasons not to give up

The context of this quote is sketchy, but can make sense, with other contexts as well - aside from thievery.

```quote
(...) When society refuses you the right to exist, you have to take it and not help it along, which is cowardice.
                -- Clément Duval
```

OBS: Not everybody steals, because of "the exploitation of man by man".

Why am I talking about stealing? Read the bio of Clément Duval.
