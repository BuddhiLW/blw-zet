# OCR - Optical Character Recognition

Currently (20230612173404), there are not many ways to convert full-blown images to TeX. Ideally, that would solve the problem of converting books, notes etc (digitalized to actual software-produced-books; or pure digital data, with characters etc.)

You can actually convert pure text (images), or pure math (images) to text and `TeX` respectively. But, can't convert an image that have both text and math
