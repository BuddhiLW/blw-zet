# Movies - Devil's Advocate

We will use the pentad of motives [^1].

``` quote
In rhetoric and composition, the pentad is the set of five problem-solving probes that answer the
following questions:

* What was done (act)?
* When and where was it done (scene)?
* Who did it (agent)?
* How was it done (agency)?
* Why was it done (purpose)?
```

What was the **Motive**?

What are the characters:
- Kevin Lomax, the lawyer;
- Marry Ann Lomax, Kevin's wife;
- Alice Lomax, Kevin's mother;
- John Milton (Bill), the chief of New York's biggest criminal law-firm;
- John's (Bill's) associates;

## Act

Selling your knowledge of the "most probable truth", for *money*, *fame* and *power*.

Exchange the *well-being* of his family - his wife, mother and the possibility of having a child -, for the ability of winning any case.


Some examples are:

When Kevin had delusions of having another women, while having sex with his wife. At the same time, he chose not to believe on Marry Ann's visions and symbolical events.

He chose not to give up a case, in order to take care of his wife, and just go forward on a dirty case and defend a triple-homicide.

He could have returned home, but decided to go all night out to a party. While, Marry was suffering at home, "sick".

## Scene

The heavily "court" of life. The daily actions happen in:
- The "material" court;
- In parties;
- In the lawyer's house;
- etc.

In whoever place where the Devil, personalized in the chief of New York's law-firm - John Milton -, can reach to violate Kevin's conscience.

## Agent

Kevin is the agent of it's own demise. But, also John Milton can be interpreted as the main agent, since he manipulates John's decisions, by making him gradually give up on it's conscience.

## Agency

Life-tests - Situational-tests. Fidelity, Truthfulness, Morals, Ethic, Devotion to money, Allegiance.

## Purpose

To turn Kevin into a puppet and a servant, by having him "by the balls". Having leverage on him, on every aspect of his life, then make him do the devil's beddings.

Through "The hand that gives, it's the hand that takes" make Kevin feel hopeless and without a refugee making it impossible to not take the Devil's bargain. Since, he does not have anything else, in the end - but material wealth.

## The **Motive** (Conclusion)

The Devil offers the fast lane, in order to become it's *devotee*, for the uprising criminal lawyer prospect. Which, until then, just started selling his conciousness.

In the end movie-scene, on the Kevin's face-off with his father, the Devil, John makes clear that his motive is to ultimately make a critique of **unrestricted free-will** that **god** gives.
