# Movies - Devil's Advocate

We will use the pentad of motives [^1].

``` quote
In rhetoric and composition, the pentad is the set of five problem-solving probes that answer the
following questions:

* What was done (act)?
* When and where was it done (scene)?
* Who did it (agent)?
* How was it done (agency)?
* Why was it done (purpose)?
```

What was the **Motive**?

What are the characters:
- Kevin, the lawyer;
- Marry Ann, Kevin's wife;
- John (Bill), the chief of New York's biggest criminal law-firm;
- John's (Bill's) associates;
- Kevin's mother;

## Act

Selling your knowledge of the most probable truth, for *money*, *fame* and *life-quality*.

Exchange the *well-being* of his family, for the ability of winning any case. His wife, mother and the possibility of having a child. 

## Scene

The heavily "court" of life. The daily actions happen in 
- The "material" court; 
- In parties; 
- In the lawyer's house; 
- etc.

In whoever place where the Devil, personalized in the chief of New York's law-firm, can reach to violate Kevin's conscience.

## Agent

## Agency

## Purpose
