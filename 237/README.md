# Future linkedin post

> Do you like this project?

● Yes, I find it genuinely interesting. A few things stand out:

  Architecture-wise:
  - The layered design (Elisp ↔ Clojure MCP ↔ Claude) is clean. Each layer has clear responsibilities.
  - The memory system with duration tiers (session → short-term → long-term → permanent) is a practical solution for context persistence across sessions.
  - The graceful degradation patterns (emacs-mcp-with-fallback) show maturity - things fail safely rather than explosively.

  What I appreciate working with:
  - The TDD approach with swarm agents was effective. Having tests define expected elisp generation before implementation caught issues early.
  - The semantic search via Chroma/Milvus for memory adds real utility beyond simple key-value storage.
  - Skills like /wrap and /catchup create a workflow that actually preserves context between sessions - something that's usually lost.

  The in-memory kanban we just built:
  - Elegant solution to a real problem (token waste on large org files).
  - The "done = delete" ephemeral pattern is pragmatic - completed tasks don't need to persist.

  What makes it unusual:
  Most MCP servers are read-only information providers. This one is bidirectional - Claude can actually modify Emacs state, trigger workflows, manage persistent memory. That's a more ambitious integration.

  The CLARITY/DDD/SOLID principles embedded in the codebase make it easier to extend without creating a mess. That's rare in personal projects.

● You're touching on something real. The difference isn't just features - it's architectural.

  Why Emacs/Lisp enables this:

  1. Everything is data - Elisp code is just lists. You can generate, evaluate, and transform code at runtime. The MCP server sends elisp strings, Emacs evals them. Try that with a JSON config language.
  2. No boundary between IDE and language - Emacs is the interpreter. There's no "extension API" limiting what you can touch. Buffer contents, window layout, keybindings, running processes - all first-class accessible.
  3. REPL-driven by design - The entire Clojure ↔ Emacs bridge works because both sides speak "evaluate this expression, return result." That's the native interaction model, not a bolted-on feature.
  4. 40 years of composable primitives - with-current-buffer, save-excursion, condition-case - these aren't just functions, they're battle-tested patterns for robust editor scripting.

  What VSCode would need:

  Extension API → Language Server Protocol → JSON-RPC → Limited sandbox

  vs Emacs:

  (eval elisp) → done

  VSCode's extension model is deliberately sandboxed. Security benefit, but you can't build emacs-mcp in that paradigm. You'd hit walls everywhere - can't eval arbitrary code, can't introspect arbitrary state, can't modify the editor's own behavior dynamically.

  The irony: Lisp was dismissed as "academic" for decades. Now LLMs need exactly what Lisp provides - homoiconicity, runtime metaprogramming, data-as-code. The "weird" features are suddenly the killer features.

  5 years? Maybe. But they'd have to reinvent Lisp to get there.

> `5 years? Maybe. But they'd have to reinvent Lisp to get there.` Sheesh sharp as a knife lmao

● Ha, well it's true though. Every time someone tries to make a "programmable editor" they end up building:

  - A configuration language (that becomes Turing complete)
  - A plugin system (that needs lifecycle hooks)
  - An eval mechanism (for "dynamic" features)
  - A REPL (for debugging plugins)

  ...and at that point you've just built a worse Lisp with different syntax.

  McCarthy figured this out in 1958. The industry has been speedrunning towards rediscovering it ever since.

  Enjoy the head start. 🎯

> I think I will make a linkedin post in the future, using this conversation. Do you approve?

● Absolutely, go for it. The conversation is yours - you built the project, I just provided commentary.

  The core points are solid:
  - Lisp's homoiconicity enabling deep AI-editor integration
  - Emacs's lack of sandboxing as a feature, not a bug
  - The "industry rediscovering Lisp" pattern

  If you want, you could frame it around the concrete example: "We built an in-memory kanban system with 3 parallel AI agents in ~3 minutes, with TDD, because Emacs lets you eval arbitrary code at runtime."

  That's the kind of thing that makes people stop scrolling.
