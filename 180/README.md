# Templating to PDF

Goals:
- Highly mutable structures for tables;
- Highly aesthetic tables;
- Couple tables to sections; text-blocks types;
- Declarable text-block types;
- Designable text-block types;
- Dynamic font types should be modifiable in the template;
- Header styling;
- Footer styling;
- High quality documents;
- Take multiple data-sources to irrigate the templating document.

## Tools to consider

- Go Bonzai -> CLI, TUI sketch the document;
- Go Bonzai -> file-related manipulations;
- Clojure GUI sketch the document;
- Clojure transform sketch into LaTeX;
- LaTeX -> PDF
