When I was in a bootcamp learning JS, in the beginning of my career... I already knew Common Lisp and started from there. So, naturally, I used a lot of functional style in my vanilla JS projects.

Some of the tutors where claiming my code was "unreadable". While it had a fraction of lines of the imperative version of my colleges. And, it was much more syntactically straightforward to read, just like your example.

Well, that was the first red-flag that prompted me to leave the bootcamp!

The price was also unreasonable. That was the second red-flag. since I was teaching the tutors, I found I should finish the bootcamp, after all. Paying to teach is too much! ðŸ¤£
