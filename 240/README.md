## Powerful testing paradigms

```
  1. Property-Based Testing (Generative)

  - "Property-Based Testing with PropEr, Erlang, and Elixir" — Fred Hebert. The only dedicated book on the topic. Covers thinking in
  properties, stateful testing, shrinking. Directly applicable even if you're in Clojure (concepts transfer 1:1 to test.check).
  - https://www.cs.tufts.edu/~nr/cs257/archive/john-hughes/quviq-testing.pdf — The original research. Hughes co-created QuickCheck (1999),
  then founded https://codesync.global/speaker/john-hughes/ to commercialize it. His talks are the best entry point.

  2. Mutation Testing

  - https://www.amazon.com/Introduction-Software-Testing-Paul-Ammann/dp/1107172012 — Paul Ammann & Jeff Offutt (2nd ed., Cambridge). The
  textbook treatment of mutation analysis as a criterion-based testing technique. Covers mutation operators, equivalent mutants, and the
  competent programmer hypothesis.
  - http://crest.cs.ucl.ac.uk/fileadmin/crest/sebasepaper/JiaH09b.pdf — "An Analysis and Survey of the Development of Mutation Testing." The
  definitive survey paper, covers the full history.

  3. Linearizability / Concurrent Testing

  - https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/the-art-of/9780123973375/xhtml/Contents.html — Herlihy & Shavit. Chapter 3 covers linearizability.
  The theoretical foundation.
  - https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/designing-data-intensive-applications/9781098119058/ — Martin Kleppmann (2nd ed.). Chapters on
  consistency models, linearizability in practice. More applied than Herlihy.
  - https://jepsen.io/consistency/models/linearizable + https://github.com/jepsen-io/knossos — Kyle Kingsbury's tools. Not a book, but the
  Jepsen analyses are the best practical case studies. Knossos is the linearizability checker we approximated with defprop-concurrent-safe.

  4. Metamorphic Testing

  - https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3143561 — Chen et al. (ACM Computing Surveys, 2018). The comprehensive survey. This is the "textbook" for
  the field since no dedicated book exists yet.
  - The https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metamorphic_testing is actually a solid starting point for the core idea.

  5. Characterization / Golden Testing

  - "Working Effectively with Legacy Code" — Michael Feathers. Coined "characterization tests" — lock down existing behavior before
  refactoring. Chapter on "I Need to Make a Change. What Methods Should I Test?"

  The one-book-if-you-read-one

  Fred Hebert's property-based testing book. The thinking in properties mindset subsumes the others — metamorphic relations are properties,
  mutation testing validates properties, and linearizability checking is a concurrent property.
