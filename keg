title:   BuddhiLW's KEG

state:   (bearly) living

summary:
  ðŸ‘‹ Hey there! The KEG community welcomes you. This is an initial
  sample `keg` file. It uses a simplified YAML format. (If you know JSON,
  you know this.) Go ahead and change this summary and anything else you
  like, but keep in mind the following:
  
  * The updated line MUST be the first line
  * Everything *but* the updated line is optional
  * You can leave the indexes section alone (they are on by default)
  * Change **creator** to the URL for your main keg
  * Change the **url** to the main place to find this keg
  * Change **state** only if you are planning something more formal
  * Keep the **zero node** created to link to for planned content
  
  If you are a `vim` user you might want to add something like the
  following to your `.vimrc`:
  
    au bufnewfile,bufRead keg set ft=yaml

indexes:
  - file: dex/latest.md
    summary: latest changes
  - file: dex/nodes.tsv
    summary: all nodes by id
