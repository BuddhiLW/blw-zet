# MkDocs and KEG

MkDocs (Make Docs) can create some awesome documentation, based on   some markdown, like this: [crawlai docs](https://docs.crawl4ai.com/).

Checkout:
- MkDocs: https://www.mkdocs.org/
- The CSS used in crawlai docs: https://github.com/ntno/mkdocs-      terminal
- highlightjs: https://highlightjs.org/demo#lang=elm&v=1&theme=arta

Interesting inspirations for a "KEG MkDocs"-mixer into a website.

## [rwxrob](https://github.com/rwxrob) abandoning KEG

Inspired by the innovations-wave of `LLM`s, Rob abandoned the        project of a KEG (*Knowledge Exchange Graph*) for the use of MkDocs  for everything. So it can more easily be parsed and disposed in the  web for parsing.

See his entry on the matter: [Do NOT do Zettelkasten](https://rwxrob.github.io/blog/#_do_not_do_zettelkasten).

``` quote
This was a very hard realization. It meant that all my work on KEG   and kn tool was for not. I spend hundreds of hours on those projects and locking away knowledge in the most useful, simple format         (Markdown) possible. And yet I could never have anticipated the      impact and immediate knowledge indexing capabilities of              AIâ€”specifically ChatGPT.
