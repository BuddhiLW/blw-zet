# Time alone

Last week I just shipped an application to production. Many companies, projects and alike will use it. They can put all clearence data into it and get a nice PDF in the end, with legit data, and verification codes and access, to their expending, so to show everything is ok (to the gov.).

Ok, fine with me. Hope they are happy as hell. But, I'm only reciving 1000$ to do it monthly. Fuck me, mate. Really. They reap so much profit out of me, it's insane. Each project that goes through this platform expends money on the millions and the miserable me am only reciving thousand dollar payments to make it possible.

Where can I go so I can fuck off these lossers that can do shit technically? At least slice the fucking cake properly, will you?
