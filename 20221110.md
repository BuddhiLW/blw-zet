# Containers

## QAs

- What is `IPCs`? (221110134251-03)

  `ipcs` (command) shows information on the `inter-process communication`
  facilities for which the calling process has read access. By default, it shows
  information about all three resources: `shared memory segments`, `message queues`, and `semaphore arrays`.

- What are `Registries`? (221110134403-03)

  Where you can `share` and `access` container images. The main example is [hub.docker.com](hub.docker.com)

## Containers and Linux

- Containers are based on features offered by the Linux OS.
- Linux Kernel `Namespaces` provide `strict isolation` between system components at different levels.
  Examples of components mapping to different namespaces are: `network`, `file`, `users`, `processes`, `IPCs` etc.
- Linux `CGroups` offers **resource allocation** and **limitation**
- The most common solutions are `docker` and `podman` (normally used in RedHat environments).

## Container Runtimes

- Enables to `start` and `run` the container on top of the `OS`.
- It's the engine that makes possible that applications be run on containers.
- There are many container runtime solutions.
  - `docker`
  - `lxc`
  - `rnc`
  - `cri-o`
  - `containerd`
- Different container applications will have varying runtime solutions.

## Understanding Docker

- Docker offers: container image format; `Dockerfile` to building container
  images; a way to manage container images; run containers; manage container
  instances; and a solution to share them.

## Commands

`docker run -d -p 8080:80 --name="myapache" -v /var/www/html:/var/www/html httpd`
