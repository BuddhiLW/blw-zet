# Cryptography -- Steganography

`(...) Key-dependent steganographic schemes` uses cryptography, following Kerchkhoffs principle, to the maximum.

Só se guarda segredo daquilo que não se sabe

``` quote
The advantage of steganography over cryptography alone is that the intended secret message does not attract attention to itself as an object of scrutiny. Plainly visible encrypted messages, no matter how unbreakable they are, arouse interest and may in themselves be incriminating.

## A hyperbole

The emperor has no clothes, yet no one talks about it! Because they are blinded by convention. The convention being, it's normal to everyone to wear cloths, but the emperor; and whoever questions that is sentenced to *silent death*. 

People disappear; are delegitimized; politically and journalisticaly persecuted; only covertly silenced. To give an impression that the secret itself is not a secret. Only who knows the design of the secret (the passcodes) really know it's real content (the fact that the emperor has no clothes and the bits around it - how it's a fact, in it's entirety, not only the public part, that he clearly is nude).

## Kerckhoffs's principle

The fact that the emperor has no clothes, in this hyperbole, means: the system shows it's internals. Yet, this secret, this conspiracy if you will, in its entirety is unknown to everyone.

``` quote
However, if a system is secure even when the enemy knows everything except the key, then all that is needed is to manage keeping the keys secret
```

``` quote
principle applies beyond codes and ciphers to security systems in general: every secret creates a potential failure point. Secrecy, in other words, is a prime cause of brittleness—and therefore something likely to make a system prone to catastrophic collapse. Conversely, openness provides ductility.

## Steganography

``` quote
Steganography is the practice of representing information within another message or physical object, in such a manner that the presence of the concealed information would not be evident to an unsuspecting person's examination.

### Steganography in the age of computers

- Steghide;
- OpenStego;
- SilentEye.

All great tools to put information in seemly "inofensive" data, like a profile photo you use in your favorite social media; or that is in your table, facing in your office.

Everyone can be illuminati-like these days. Actually that's kinda of the cartoonishy-logo of `SilentEye` project. So funny.

Give it a try!
