Operational semantics: The meaning of a construct is specified by the compu-
tation it induces when it is executed on a machine. In particular, it is of
interest how the effect of a computation is produced.

Denotational semantics: Meanings are modelled by mathematical objects that
represent the effect of executing the constructs. Thus only the effect is of
interest, not how it is obtained.

Axiomatic semantics: Specific properties of the effect of executing the con-
structs are expressed as assertions. Thus there may be aspects of the execu-
tions that are ignored.
