# Cassandra, Postgres and Kafka with Clojure

<user>: How databases and database types (OLTP, RDBMS etc.), NoSQL/SQL, relate
to apache kafka?

<assistant>: Databases and database types, such as OLTP (Online Transaction
Processing) and RDBMS (Relational Database Management System), are typically
used to store and manage large amounts of structured data. These databases rely
on SQL (Structured Query Language) to manage and query the data.

Apache Kafka, on the other hand, is a distributed messaging system that is used
for real-time data streaming and processing. It is designed to handle
large-scale data ingestion and processing in real-time, making it an ideal
solution for handling and processing data streams in big data architectures.

While databases and Apache Kafka share similar goals in managing and processing
data, they are different types of technologies. However, Kafka can be used in
conjunction with databases such as RDBMS and NoSQL databases to provide a
real-time data pipeline between them. For example, Kafka can be used to capture
real-time event data from various sources and then send that data to a database
for storage and analysis. Additionally, Kafka can complement relational
databases by providing an event-driven architecture, which can enhance the speed
and efficiency of data streaming and processing.

<user>: Kafka would be more suitable to use with Cassandra or Postgres, or both
and how?

<assistant>: Both Cassandra and Postgres can be used in conjunction with Apache
Kafka, but the choice of which one to use depends on the specific use case and
requirements.

Cassandra is a NoSQL database that is optimized for handling large volumes of
unstructured or semi-structured data. Its distributed architecture and high
scalability make it a good choice for handling real-time data streams such as
those processed by Kafka. Kafka can be used with Cassandra to capture and
process data events in real-time and then store the results in Cassandra for
further analysis.

Postgres, on the other hand, is an RDBMS that has a rich set of features for
querying and managing structured data. While not specifically optimized for
handling real-time data streaming, it can still work effectively in conjunction
with Kafka by providing a reliable, transactional database with ACID compliance
for storing data. In this case, Kafka can be used to capture and process
real-time data, which can be written to Postgres for querying and analysis.

Ultimately, the choice between Cassandra and Postgres depends on the specific
requirements of the use case, such as the type of data being processed, the
level of scalability needed, and the desired features and functionality of the
database. In some cases, it may even be desirable to use both Cassandra and
Postgres in combination, with Kafka acting as the data pipeline between them.

<user>: How can I write clojure code that achieves the later?

<assistant>: To write Clojure code that achieves using Apache Kafka with either
Cassandra or Postgres, you'll need to first add the Kafka dependency to your
project. Here's how you can add the dependency using Leiningen in your
`project.clj` file:

```
:dependencies [...
               [org.apache.kafka/kafka-clients "2.7.0"]]
```

Once you've added the Kafka dependency, you can start writing your Clojure code.

First, you'll need to create a Kafka producer that will send data events to the
Kafka cluster. Here's an example of how you can create a Kafka producer in
Clojure:

```clojure
(require '[org.apache.kafka.clients.producer :as producer])

(defn kafka-producer [bootstrap-servers]
  (let [props {:bootstrap.servers bootstrap-servers}]
    (producer/new-producer props)))
```

In this example, `bootstrap-servers` is a string that specifies the addresses of
the Kafka brokers that your producer will connect to.

Next, you'll need to create a Kafka consumer that will receive data events from
Kafka and write them to either Cassandra or Postgres. Here's an example of how
you can create a Kafka consumer in Clojure:

```clojure
(require '[org.apache.kafka.clients.consumer :as consumer])

(defn kafka-consumer [bootstrap-servers group-id topic]
  (let [props {:bootstrap.servers bootstrap-servers
               :group.id group-id
               :enable.auto.commit false
               :auto.offset.reset "latest"
               :key.deserializer
               org.apache.kafka.common.serialization.StringDeserializer
               :value.deserializer
               org.apache.kafka.common.serialization.StringDeserializer}]
    (consumer/new-consumer props)
    (.subscribe consumer [topic])))
```

In this example, `bootstrap-servers` and `topic` are strings that specify the Kafka
brokers to connect to and the topic to subscribe to, respectively. `group-id` is a
string that identifies the consumer group that your consumer will belong to.

Once you've created your Kafka consumer, you can start processing data events.
Here's an example of how you can write each data event to Cassandra using the
`clojurewerkz.cassaforte` library:

```clojure
(require '[clojurewerkz.cassaforte.client :as cassaforte])

(defn process-event-to-cassandra [event]
  (let [ks (:keyspace cassandra-client)
        cf-name "events"
        cf (cassaforte/fetch-column-family cassandra-client ks cf-name)
        row-key (str event)
        column (cassaforte/make-column event row-key)
        mutation (cassaforte/make-mutation cf [column])]
    (cassaforte/execute cassandra-client ks mutation)))
```

In this example, `cassandra-client` is a reference to your Cassandra client that
you've created using the `clojurewerkz.cassaforte` library.

Alternatively, if you want to write each data event to Postgres, you can use the
`java.jdbc` library to connect to your Postgres database and execute SQL
statements. Here's an example of how you can insert each data event into a
Postgres table named `events`:

```clojure
(require '[clojure.java.jdbc :as jdbc])

(defn process-event-to-postgres [event]
  (jdbc/insert! db "events" {:data event}))
```

In this example, `db` is a reference to your Postgres database that you've created
using the `jdbc` library.

Finally, to process each data event as it arrives, you can use a loop that polls
for new events from Kafka and writes them to Cassandra or Postgres:

```clojure
(defn start-processing [bootstrap-servers group-id topic]
  (let [consumer (kafka-consumer bootstrap-servers group-id topic)
        cassandra-client (cassaforte/client {:hosts ["127.0.0.1"]}) ;;replace
        with your own Cassandra cluster
        db {:pool-size 10
            :jdbc-url "jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/my_database"
            :username "my_user"
            :password "my_password"}] ;;replace with your own Postgres database
            credentials
    (loop []
      (let [records (.poll consumer 1000)]
        (doseq [record records]
          (let [event (-> record .value)]
            (process-event-to-cassandra cassandra-client event)
            (process-event-to-postgres db event))))
      (recur))))
```

In this example, `start-processing` is a function that starts the Kafka consumer
and polls for new data events every second. It then calls the
`process-event-to-cassandra` and `process-event-to-postgres` functions to write each
data event to Cassandra and Postgres, respectively.

This is just a basic example of how you can use Clojure with Kafka and either
Cassandra or Postgres. There are many other ways to handle Kafka topics, and
numerous libraries for interacting with Cassandra and Postgres.
