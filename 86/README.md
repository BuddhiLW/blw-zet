# Why Clojure?

```
I am very glad you asked!

I wrote and deployed (to production) some Clojure code at Netflix just yesterday. Among other things at Netflix the Mantis Query Language (MQL an SQL for streaming data) which ferries around approximately 2 trillion events every day for operational analysis (SPS alerting, quality of experience metrics, debugging production, etc) is written entirely in Clojure.

This runs in nearly every critical service, ~3000 ASGs and easily > 100k servers and Clojure allows us to also compile it for our NodeJS services as well.
