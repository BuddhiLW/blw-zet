# Why Clojure?

```
I am very glad you asked!

I wrote and deployed (to production) some Clojure code at Netflix just yesterday. Among other things at Netflix the Mantis Query Language (MQL an SQL for streaming data) which ferries around approximately 2 trillion events every day for operational analysis (SPS alerting, quality of experience metrics, debugging production, etc) is written entirely in Clojure.

This runs in nearly every critical service, ~3000 ASGs and easily > 100k servers and Clojure allows us to also compile it for our NodeJS services as well.

Você sabia que essas empresas utilizam Datomic (banco de dados escrito, e nativo de Clojure)?



Aliás, a lista não para por aí. Essas gigantes, Adobe, Apple, Facebook, Amazon, Oracle, Zalando and SoundCloud, Spotify e Nubank todas possuem aplicações na língua.



É, e a maneira mais simples de fazer o deploy é pela AWS - a qual tem suporte extensivo, para esse caso de uso.
