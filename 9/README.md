# The divergent series (20221128185105)

The bullshit of "Chicago" being the only city that was left on the planet.
The so north-american-centric reality of Hollywood! God damn! Not only once
they let go of the talks of "superiority". Even, in apocalyptical futures,
at movies. 

Then, there is the famous "rules are rules", and the love for "lawful" cities, 
mixed with military on steroids. That would be the perfect scenary for any 
sucesseful movie for their bs-culture (**BS: Bad Science**).

Not to talk of the constant speak of "The Grater Good", the most fallecious shit
shoved down people's troath, globally.

Of course, we could forget the "soldier Ryan" incarnated, to be the muscle-man 
for "Big Bussiness" (as is historically has been told by Smedly Butler).

In this case, of course, these are not big bussiness, but the factions; the 
powers that be; the status quo.

Oh, but you would tell me, the plot is exactly the solution of such confrict and 
ethos. And, for that, I would say: bullshit. The plot is a big solution for the 
problems that we have created. And, if nothing else, it's a hole narrative to 
normalize such situations of justified-wars. The payment: absolute power.

North-American film industry, more like the propoganda-complex for the 
North-american values.
