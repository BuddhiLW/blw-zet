# Semantics with Applications (Hanne Riis Nielson, Flemming Nielso)

- Operational Semantics;
- Denotational Semantics;
- Axiomatic Semantics.

**Operational semantics:** "The meaning of a construct is specified by the computation it induces when it is executed on a machine. In particular, it is of interest how the effect of a computation is produced."

**Denotational semantics:** "Meanings are modelled by mathematical objects that represent the effect of executing the constructs. Thus only the effect is of interest, not how it is obtained."

**Axiomatic semantics:** "Specific properties of the effect of executing the constructs are expressed as assertions. Thus there may be aspects of the executions that are ignored."
