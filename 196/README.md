- How to do `Symbolical Differentiation`?
- Differentiation you would do in a paper, symbolically.

## Derivatives

Derivatives as local approximations.

Reference: **Calculus on Manifolds**, by *Michael Spivak*

## Composition

### Sequential

The derivative of a composition of functions is equivalent to the composition of derivatives.

```
D(g.f)a = [(D(g).f)a].[D(f)a]
```

### Parallel

Light: vetorial product behaviour of Electro and Magnetic fields.
