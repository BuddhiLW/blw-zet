# Dotfiles: the struggle is real

Creating a personal amalgamation of bash scripts for installing dependencies, symbolical links, moving files around and installing GitHub packages et al., can be tiresome. I know, right? I feel that way too.

But, once you do, you feel much more secure. I can crash, or run into a crash on an update and It's very OK. Because, it's all sourced. And you know all you have to do is base-install a distro, run a script and BAM, you are at your development environment yet again.

So, for the sake of sanity, take your time and do it!

You can base your scripts on others, or you could not even look at anyone else's and invent your own. But, just start organizing it; it's super important.

Here you can inspire yourself on my own, that I took about a week to create[^1]. It's supposed to run on top of a `apt-based` (Debian, Ubuntu, etc) distribution.
