# REST API, Unit and Functional test

## REST API

- What is the `REST architecture`? (221108143157-03)
  > 1. `Uniform interface`. All API requests for the same resource should look the same, no matter
  >    where the request comes from. The REST API should ensure that the same piece of data, such
  >    the name or email address of a user, belongs to only one uniform resource identifier (URI).
  >    Resources shouldn’t be too large but should contain every piece of information that the
  >    client might need.
  > 2. `Client-server decoupling`. In REST API design, client and server applications must be
  >    completely independent of each other. The only information the client application should know
  >    is the URI of the requested resource; it can't interact with the server application in any
  >    other ways. Similarly, a server application shouldn't modify the client application other
  >    than passing it to the requested data via HTTP.
  > 3. `Statelessness`. REST APIs are stateless, meaning that each request needs to include all the
  >    information necessary for processing it. In other words, REST APIs do not require any
  >    server-side sessions. Server applications aren’t allowed to store any data related to a
  >    client request.
  > 4. `Cacheability`. When possible, resources should be cacheable on the client or server side.
  >    Server responses also need to contain information about whether caching is allowed for the
  >    delivered resource. The goal is to improve performance on the client side, while increasing
  >    scalability on the server side.
  > 5. `Layered system architecture`. In REST APIs, the calls and responses go through different
  >    layers. As a rule of thumb, don’t assume that the client and server applications connect
  >    directly to each other. There may be a number of different intermediaries in the
  >    communication loop. REST APIs need to be designed so that neither the client nor the server
  >    can tell whether it communicates with the end application or an intermediary.
  > 6. `Code on demand (optional)`. REST APIs usually send static resources, but in certain cases,
  >    responses can also contain executable code (such as Java applets). In these cases, the code
  >    should only run on-demand.

## Unit and Functional test

- `Unit testing `:

  > In computer programming, unit testing is a software testing
  > method by which individual units of source code—sets of one or more computer
  > program modules together with associated control data, usage procedures, and
  > operating procedures — are tested to determine whether they are fit for use.

  - As I understood, can be tightly coupled with methods like `TDD (Test Driven Development)`.

- `Dynamic testing`:

  > Functional Testing + Dynamic testing with functional test technology enables the team to check compliance
  > with functional specifications of product software features and components specified
  > before the testing process is started. + In addition, this technique
  > involves carrying out functional test cases to enable them
  > to obtain accurate and anticipated results. Functional testing is carried out with the
  > help of different test types, which play an extremely important role in determining the
  > software’s performance and function. + Functional Testing has four different
  > types, which are 1. System Testing 2. Integration Testing 3. Acceptance
  > Testing 4. Unit Testing
