# Go testing; TDD

## Rules to create a test

> Writing a test is just like writing a function, with a few rules.
>
> - It needs to be in a file with a name like `xxx_test.go`
> - The `test function` must start with the word `Test`
> - The `test function` takes one argument only t `*testing.T`
>   In order to use the `*testing.T type`, you need to `import "testing"`, like we
>   did with `fmt` in the other file.
>
> For now, it's enough to know that your t of type `*testing.T` is your "hook"
> into the testing framework so you can do things like `t.Fail()` when you want to
> fail.

## Go and TDD, `hello world` example

> In our case we've gone from Hello() to Hello("name"), to Hello("name", "French")
> in small, easy to understand steps.
>
> This is of course trivial compared to "real world" software but the principles
> still stand. TDD is a skill that needs practice to develop, but by breaking
> problems down into smaller components that you can test, you will have a much
> easier time writing software.
