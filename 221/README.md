# At a crossroads

Using AI to take smart decisions on politics - e.g., what path to take, for a better future and outcome (virtue).

```
I have the following situation. I'm still studying kubernetes and stuff. I have a kong gateway working in my server, exposing my database for some few services.

I intend to migrate it  to a subdomain in an ingress setup. But, I feel I may need more time learning and experimenting with kubernetes, before I make this transition in setup, without breaking the working, up and running environment.

At the same time, there are some apps I would like to deploy in that ingress setup, or another port. The thing is, to liberate another different port in my server would be quite the hassle. And ingress falls in the later problem.

What path would you instruct me to take?
```

Have you used LLMs to guide you on that way, also?
