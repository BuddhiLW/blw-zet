# Aljazeera Investigations Doc 07, Out

- Netanyahu stated lies
- Blinken repeated those lies, as facts - without de facto investigations

## Agent
``` quote
You need a great Martial routine. We win peacefully in thousands. 

But, what was the response of the international community? Nothing.

Keeping the ears and eyes always closed.

Within this context, we have discussed in many time and in many sessions: what can we do? Generally, there was a consensus in the political bureau.

We have to move; we have to take action. If we don't do it, Palestine will be forgotten totally and deleted from the international map.

The plan and date(?) was known by the Israeli intelligence - The Chief of Military Intelligence was aware of the situation. And, refuse to take counter-measures.

"who was the chief of military intelligence of israel in october 7th?"
Lieutenant General Herzi Halevi


``` quote
 An intelligence unit had also observed a rehearsal
 exercise in Gaza City, and drawn the document and exercise
 together to correctly assess the relevance of both. The
 analyst had shown remarkable insight when she suggested to
 her superiors that the rehearsal was not for a raid, but
 an invasion, according to evidence collected by the New
 York Times.

 ---------------------

 Why was the correct assessment overlooked?

   The assessment about Hamas appears to have been dismissed
   for three key reasons.

   First, a belief that Hamas did not have the capabilities
   to carry out the attack, nor the intention to do so
   because it would fall outside of their historic pattern of
   behaviour.

   Second, these beliefs about Hamas were not thoroughly
   challenged within Israeli intelligence nor through sharing
   the assessment with international partners who might have
   had useful intelligence on this.

   Third, Israeli defences, be they deeply buried sensors,
   walls, or automatically defended sections of the border,
   were considered to be too strong for Hamas.

   It is not clear from the information that has come to
   light so far whether the accurate intelligence assessment
   about Hamas was shared with the prime ministerâ€™s office,
   or with international allies, such as the US.
