# SQLite and the Three Musketeers

## Disclaimer

I don't remember the exact place/quote. But it was about how the caprice of powerful people often leads in drastic changes in the destiny of the commoner. So, LLMs help me find a quotes that happens in The Three Musketeers in this context; there are not only one - which I have read in a Portuguese by Martin Claret, but which I can't recite from memory.

## Chapter 19 – "The Interview with Anne of Austria"

``` quote
"Les volontés des rois, des cardinaux et des ducs ne sont que des caprices du sort qui mènent les hommes vers des fins qu'ils n'ont jamais envisagées."
```

``` quote
"The wills of kings, cardinals, and dukes are but whims of fate that lead men to ends they have never imagined."
```

## SQLite

Ok, what does it have to do with **SQLite**? Well, it happens that historically, SQLite is the result of a serendipitous event, based on caprice and whims of powerful people. I explain.

``` quote
(...) I didn’t do that [SQLite] right away, but later on, it was a funding hiatus. This was back in 2000, and if I recall correctly, Newt Gingrich and Bill Clinton were having a fight of some sort, so all government contracts got shut down, so I was out of work for a few months, and I thought, “Well, I’ll just write that database engine now.”
