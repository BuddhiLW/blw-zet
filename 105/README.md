# Practical Physics

(Context: about an image-post on "two-phrase-explanations" of relativistic equations and the gravitational force. Over-simplification)

That only makes sense for bodies that are close to the speed of light (generally, that happens with bodies close to atomic-particles size) or with extremely heavy objects (planets, stars etc).

**Those equations don't bring much insight into understanding motion of most objects at our range of perception-experience.**

One should study **Variational Principles of Mechanics**, or so-called **Classical Physics**, for that matter.

It (is) would be very practical. 

For example, with these tools, you can solve problems like this: "Given two points A and B in a vertical plane, what is the curve traced out by a point acted on only by gravity, which starts at A and reaches B in the shortest time.", in other words, what's the quickest path of descent from point A to B, under gravity (a problem with historical significance).
