# Managing Open Source Contributions (20250201182222)

Effectiveness in life is the name of the game.

I have one life. Better make it the best I can. Use my potentialities to the best of my abilities; hopefully build useful things along the way. And, share most of it freely; even more so, when I'm auto sufficient.

So, let's get my hands dirty.

## Efforts to do so

Tools to be used: Org Mode; Org Agenda; Integrate (Google etc) Agenda APIs.

TODO stage projects:
- **ELM-KEG** the template for a KEG, **indexable** by *LLMs*, *SEO-optimized*, website;
- Video processing vid2vid pipeline real-time processing;
- Continue working in *KEG*;
- Captions video-automation;
- Self-management with Org Mode - track myself; quantify myself; use pomodoro;

The **self-management** of these contributions and projects can be accompanied in the following repository.
