## Alexandroni Soldiers interviews

### Teddy Katz

He was persecuted in university for gathering historical evidence for the massacre of the Palestinian people, in the Tantura Village.

## How they treated everyone in the displacement

The lined people and shot them in cold blood. Also, soldiers raped whoever they found attractive; mostly young girls, not even adults yet.

They also tortured some of them; even going so far as cutting the genitalia and making them eat it.

Two mass graves were dug.

## The remaining things in the village became stolen property

Houses etc were stolen. All the property became European occupier's houses. Mostly, people that just had been through a genocide.

This is what one of the sickest things I ever could fathom.

Survive through a period of persecution; go to another country and decimate the natives. Becoming as inhumane as their killers in Europe.

In some aspects, it is even more monstrous. The way the made themselves "forget" about what they did. What have transpired.

Do they really live in a fairy tale, in which that space was theirs; and they peacefully displaced people from their homes?

This doesn't happen.

They could have shared a life together.

But, they chose to murder, rape, pillage, and massacre the native people.


## What was Tantura, in the Al-Nakba?

``` quote
Over two-thirds of the Palestinian towns and villages had been destroyed and their populations expelled; 100,000 Arabs or fewer escaped this fate, representing about half of those who were living in the Galilee until the end of 1947. 

It is true that more Palestinian residents remained in the Galilee than in any other area occupied by Israel in 1948; nevertheless, ethnic cleansing in some parts of the Galilee was almost total.

In the villages of upper Galilee closer to the Lebanese border, however, the war crimes and expulsions were more severe and cruel. The Israeli army carried out killings (including massacres), pillaged, and raped in a number of border villages, including Safsaf, Saliha, Jish, Hula, and Sa‘sa‘, on the day the villages were occupied or shortly thereafter.

The killings and expulsions were carried out in villages that had put up no resistance to the occupiers.
