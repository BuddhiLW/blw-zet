# The Specter of Communism

To this day, we can hear and read about the `shadow` of communism and 
socialism. This term was famously used by Karl Marx, at the preface of `The 
Communist Manifesto`.

> “A specter is haunting Europe—the specter of Communism. All the powers of old Europe have entered into a holy
> alliance to exorcise this specter; Pope and Czar, Metternich and Guizot, French radicals and German police spies.
> Where is the party in opposition that has not been decried as Communistic by its opponents in power? Where the
> opposition that has not hurled back the branding reproach of Communism, against the more advanced opposition
> parties, as well as against its reactionary adversaries?
> Two things result from this fact.
> I. Communism is already acknowledged by all European powers to be in itself a power.
> II. It is high time that Communists should openly, in the face of the whole world, publish their views, their
> aims, their tendencies, and meet this nursery tale of the Specter of Communism with a Manifesto of the party
> itself.”[^1]

To this day, the attacks on "communism", while using all sorts of fallacies and 
personal attacks to the rethorical-counterpart. The most common ones relates to 
arguments boiling down to:

1. Any supporter of these systems _must not_ use cutting-edge technology. (Else 
they are hypocrites)
2. Any supporter _must not_ be rich, or use their money, in a conspicuous 
manner.
3. Any supporter _must not_ be portrait as an altruist, socially conscient, and 
organized.
4. Most commonly, any event regarding corruption will associated with 
socialism.
