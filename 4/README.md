A businesslike control of the rate and volume of output is indispensable for
keeping up a profitable market, and a profitable market is the first and
unremitting condition of prosperity in any community whose industry is owned and
managed by business men. And the ways and means of this necessary control of the
output of industry are always and necessarily something in the nature of
sabotage — something in the way of retardation, restriction, withdrawal,
unemployment of plant and workmen — whereby production is kept short of
productive capacity.
