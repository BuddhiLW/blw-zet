# Storybook

If you develop frontend applications, you should learn about [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org). It's a tool for building UI components in isolation. It's the TDD of frontend development... More or less. But, it's as an ideal code-as-documentation tool AND testing tool you will ever find (or maybe not, but it's really good).

Plus, it's used by the big boys. Yeah. But, no one will tell you about it, if they know, and want to have an edge.
