# Architectures

- Mainframe (server-focused)
- Client-Server (Object/Pascal, Delphi)
- Server-side web (PHP, ASP, HTML, CSS etc.)
- Client-side web (JavaScript, data-centric apps)
- "Modern" web: Client + Server (Next.js, React.js, etc.)
- Standalone + sync?: DataScript

# Client vs Server side rendering

- Client-side rendering: The server sends a minimal HTML page to the client, and the client uses JavaScript to render the page. This is often done with frameworks like React or Vue.
- Server-side rendering: The server generates the entire HTML page on the server, and sends it to the client. This is often done with frameworks like Next.js or Nuxt.js.
