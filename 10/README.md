# `tmux` really is awesome

Sorry to have doubted your powers... Actually, I didn't. The fact is, I wasn't 
prepared to it, I guess. Or, I didn't seem to stumble upon straight-forward 
tutorials. The `man` page wasn't too helpful as a beginning point - way too 
much information.

Well, now I found a tutorial with which I got along with[^1]. Thanks, Ian.

You may ask me, what is it to me, since I use a `Window Manager (WM)`. And, you 
are totally right in making that assertion. Because, most of the utilities 
present in `tmux` can be found in WMs, at least the tilling ones.

The anwser is simple: select text from `lynx` like a hacker and just paste it 
from the clipboard, **without the mouse**.
