# Set theory, Charles Pinter

I will start a series on my blog, [buddhilw.com](buddhilw.com), dedicated to set theory.

We will explore mathematics, where it starts. And, move up from there.

Images, formulas, tables, all will be put in together. This may even be a repository of illustration of abstract ideas, on my view. And, as complete, as in a "piece of paper".
