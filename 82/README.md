Coming back to a routine of exercise is tough. Even more so, if you were habituated not so long ago. The feeling can be of inferiority; "I can't do this, any longer". Comparisons with your-self in a different point in time.

"Certainly, I was able to do this, with my hands in the back, folded, as kid's play. And, now, I can barely stand five minutes of this. Well, I used to run 10km, and then hit the Muay Thai training sessions - now, I can't even WALK that long."

As far as those thoughts used to creep in, I don't care. That was, indeed me. And, yeah, I didn't realize then how in shape I was, and how hard it was to achieve that point. Now, I'm older, and trying to stand on my feet. That's all right! Feeling nauseous? Well, hang in there. I will take longer breaks; if I can't do this one exercise, let's go to the next one. And, so fourth, etc.

The take is, I was, and I will be! Just stick to it, as I did at first. May take longer, may never be the same, but let's stick to the plan!
