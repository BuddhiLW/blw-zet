A computer is a programmable electronic device that can process, store and retrieve data. 

It processes data according to a set of instructions or program. All computers consist of two basic parts, namely, hardware and software. The hardware is the physical part of the machine, and the components of a digital computer include memory for short-term storage of data or instructions, an arithmetic/logic unit for carrying out arithmetic and logical operations, a control unit responsible for the execution of computer instructions in memory and peripherals that handle the input and output operations. Software is a set of instructions that tells the computer what to do.

Components of a digital computer:
- Short-term memory storage;
- Arithmetic/logic unit;
- Control unit;
