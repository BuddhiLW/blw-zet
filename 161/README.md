# The ultra zionists (2011), Louis Theroux (Documentary)

## Jerusalem

``` quote
We are here today. This is the Jewish homeland. And, there never has been a Palestinian people. 

If they want to express themselves nationally. They can express (themselves) somewhere else, in the other states. Maybe Jordan, which is primarily Palestinian origin, in any case.

Why should it be at the expense of the jewish homeland? My roots are here; not theirs.
```
-- Daniel, a random zionist in a zionist movement to display palestinians from Jerusalem.


If there never has been a Palestinian people. How can Jordan be primarily of Palestinian origin?

This donkey can't even formulate his own lies straight. For fuck sake. Hearing these Zionists make my head hurt. They are so full of BS.

Anyways, continuing the documentary.
