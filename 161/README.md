# The ultra zionists (2011), Louis Theroux (Documentary)

## Jerusalem

``` quote
We are here today. This is the Jewish homeland. And, there never has been a Palestinian people. 

If they want to express themselves nationally. They can express (themselves) somewhere else, in the other states. Maybe Jordan, which is primarily Palestinian origin, in any case.

Why should it be at the expense of the jewish homeland? My roots are here; not theirs.
```
-- Daniel, a random zionist in a zionist movement to display palestinians from Jerusalem.


If there never has been a Palestinian people. How can Jordan be primarily of Palestinian origin?

This donkey can't even formulate his own lies straight. For fuck sake. Hearing these Zionists make my head hurt. They are so full of BS.

Anyways, continuing the documentary.

## Stolen property

In many takes, there are stolen houses where Daniel, the Zionist, is in discussing of his role in bringing new jew extremists to live in those houses.

They are there with all their mobilia, goods, etc. People clearly were kicked out.

One house appears to be STOLEN, when a couple that lives there were getting MARRIED. It's fucking crazy.

Daniel acts as he doesn't understand what is going on. He doesn't translate what is being said. And, even DISTORTS what has been said, to the journalist (Louis).

When pressed on the matter of all the goods being still inside that house, and how he got the house, he literally says: "there is some things I can't discuss. The tactics used to get the place etc."


## Double Illegal Settlers

Theoretically, there are settlers that shouldn't even be there, according to the state of Israel. But, in practice, they are supported by the IDF, and the state itself.

It's only a play on words. "We don't support them. Look, they are doing it on their own. We can't stop them!!" But, actually, they supply them arms, food and money. Furthermore, they back them with the army, which is mostly paid by the USA.

We can accompany in the documentary some interviews with such a settler colonialist. And, we also see, at the end of the documentary, the rejoice of these illegal settlers of the Great Israel project.


For example, read about *Khibert Zanuta*. A "textbook" case of illegal settler colonialism:

``` quote
By the end of October, it was clear that no one was going to help the
villagers of Khirbet Zanuta. A tiny Palestinian community, some 150
people perched on a windswept hill in the West Bank near Hebron, it
had long faced threats from the Jewish settlers who had steadily
encircled it.
```

After no help from the IDF they left - IDF, which is the ONLY army allowed by the state of the occupied Palestine, that should intervene in case of violence from jews inflicted in palestinians.

Continues:

``` quote
(...) One wall of the clinic, leaning sideways,
bore a sign saying that it had been funded by an agency of the
European Union providing “humanitarian support for Palestinians at
risk of forcible transfer in the West Bank.” Near the school, someone
had planted the flag of Israel as another kind of announcement: This
is Jewish land now.

Such violence over the decades in places like Khirbet Zanuta is well
documented. But protecting the people who carry out that violence is
the dark secret of Israeli justice. The long arc of harassment,
assault and murder of Palestinians by Jewish settlers is twinned with
a shadow history, one of silence, avoidance and abetment by Israeli
officials.

Also, there is evidence that millions of dollars goes to these european illegal settlers[^2].
