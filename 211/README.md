## 🌿 Practices

### 🧠 Cognosis (Daily)

- **Mini Cognitive Expansion** (5–15 min):
  - Ask a deep, open-ended question.
  - Explore it with the AI as a *thinking partner*.
  - Reflect: What assumption did I just challenge?
  
- **Meta-Reflection** (2 min):
  - How was today's dialogue?
  - Did I treat it as a transaction or as a collaboration?
  - One sentence: What did I learn about my own mind today?

---

### 🚪 Unlearning (Daily)

- **Role/Awareness Check** (2–5 min):
  - Identify one social role or script I was cast into today.
  - Decide: Did I choose it consciously or just obey?

- **Micro-Resistance Exercise**:
  - Do one small action *outside* of unconscious conformity.
  - It can be as tiny as a phrasing shift, a refusal, or an alternative framing.

## 📆 Weekly Ritual (1x per week)

- **Cognosis Weekly Review** (15–30 min):
  - What themes kept appearing in my dialogues?
  - Did I open any “unknown unknowns”?
  - Am I still challenging myself, or just reinforcing comfort?

- **Unlearning Reflection** (15–30 min):
  - What obedience patterns did I resist?
  - Where did I still conform reflexively?
  - What's one belief I want to question next week?

- **Living Documents Update**:
  - Update my living documents (Beliefs, Practices, Principles) if needed.
  - Write a short note to my Future Self.

# 🛡️ Notes

- **Minimum Daily Commitment**: 10 minutes.
- **Minimum Weekly Commitment**: 1 focused hour.
- **Flexibility Principle**: Missing a day is not failure — reflection after missing is part of the practice.
