# The Trials of Norman Finkelstein [DOC]

## Public speaker

### He traveled around the world 

He has been to many universities... Oxford and all the rest of it. Talked about the Palestinian condition; what he witnessed in the ground etc.

He ultimately was kicked out of DePaul, where he used to teach. Because, he heavily criticised another Jewish scholar, which was well connected.

Of course, for not being a Zionist and speaking against it, he would face Jewish community's backlash, similarly as if he was a goym.

This was just one of his many tribulations, while fighting for the Palestinian cause to self-determination and end of apartheid.

## "Terrorist enablers"

About Finkelstein:
``` quote
Finkelstein is a terrorist enabler: (...) They are people who are creating a climate, incrementally, in which Israel's legitimacy is no longer considered axiomatic. In which, violence against civilians is no longer axiomatically ruled-out.

``` quote
I can think of no greater punishment for him, then having to stay in line to get (inteligible). To him to have to worry about the price of food in the local grocery.

I would think the best possible solution, for Norman Finkelstein, is pulling down on Israel and see how it is to live like a jew. God would laught.
