# Enhanced API Idea for Festival Organization and Big Events (20240407173723) - Work

## Real-time Feedback and Issue Management

Collect real-time feedback from attendees regarding various aspects of the event, such as facilities, organization, performances, and overall satisfaction. The API will categorize feedback and prioritize issues based on severity, alerting staff members and assigning tasks to the appropriate teams for resolution. This facilitates prompt action and improves the overall experience for attendees.

## Automated Decision-making

Implement automation capabilities to streamline decision-making processes related to event organization. The API can analyze incoming feedback and data to suggest or execute appropriate actions, such as adjusting schedules, reallocating resources, or addressing emerging issues proactively. This enhances efficiency and reduces the burden on event organizers.

## Critical Issue Identification

Allow staff members to classify feedback based on criticality levels, enabling them to prioritize responses and interventions accordingly. Notifications will be sent to designated personnel for urgent or high-priority issues, ensuring swift resolution and minimizing disruptions during the event.

## Audience Engagement and Art Feedback

Enable attendees to provide feedback on performances, artists, and artistic elements of the event, such as music selection, stage design, and visual effects. Through the API, attendees can express their preferences, likes, and dislikes, facilitating a more interactive and tailored experience.

- Attendees can like, comment, and provide qualitative feedback on specific aspects of performances or artistic presentations.
- The API will aggregate and analyze feedback, providing sentiment analysis and ranking systems to highlight popular or trending elements.
- Organizers and artists can access insights from the API to understand audience preferences, tailor future performances or installations, and enhance audience engagement.

By leveraging real-time feedback, automated decision-making, and audience engagement features, this enhanced API empowers festival organizers and artists to deliver memorable and impactful experiences that resonate with attendees.

## Mapping terrain and interactivity

Map the eventâ€™s space and let the users interact with it. The staff also will interact with it. And, different users will be able to have different actions with the terrain.
