# "Data Compression - The Complete Reference", by David Salomon

- Compression of data must be close to - or preferably - unique, in order to represent the original data also uniquely.
- (Intriguing fact) Most data, out of all possible data of a given size, can't be compressed (because it's already compressed i.e., random).
- Compression means to reduce structural patterns in a unique - or close to unique - structure.
- Measures of frequency can be used to translate common scenarios into short representations of these scenarios.
