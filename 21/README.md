# Language and culture

Etymology of words can tell us much about a culture. An example is the world 
classroom, in Chinese. It's 课堂, which in a literal translation is "The church 
of lesson", or "lesson-church". Just by the chosen ideograms to represent such 
a worldly word, we can see how much praise they give to education - It's 
religious.
