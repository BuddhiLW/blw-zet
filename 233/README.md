# Modernizing a 28-Year-Old Funeral Home System

Family business runs on Delphi 7 + Firebird 1.5 since ~1997. 130k contributors, 2M+ payment records, 28 years of operational data. System works. No emergency.

## The Approach: Strangler Fig Pattern

Not a rewrite. Incremental replacement with parallel running.

```
Phase 1: Firebird RW → ETL → PostgreSQL RO (read-only modern layer)
Phase 2: Bidirectional sync (dual-write, domain-specific conflict resolution)
Phase 3: Cutover (PostgreSQL RW, Firebird archived)
```

## Correct Order of Operations

Most modernizations fail because they build features on shaky foundations. Did it the hard way first:

1. **Infrastructure** - Kubernetes, Terraform, Cloudflare, Envoy gateway
2. **Authentication** - Keycloak + gateway pattern (hardest to retrofit)
3. **Low-risk production apps** - cartas (letters), inventory (proves stack works)
4. **Incremental migration** - Delphi keeps working, no crisis

## Tech Stack

| Layer | Technology |
|-------|------------|
| Gateway | Envoy + Keycloak (OAuth2/OIDC) |
| Backend | Go (chi), Clojure (Pedestal) |
| Frontend | ClojureScript (Re-frame, Shadow-CLJS) |
| Database | PostgreSQL (target), Firebird (legacy, read-only) |
| Infra | Kubernetes, ArgoCD, NATS, Redis |
| Reports | Python (FastAPI, WeasyPrint) |

## Key Insight: Patience

28 years of working software buys the luxury of doing this right. Each module migrated carefully means:
- No weekend emergencies
- No data loss
- No angry family members when system is down during a funeral

The Delphi system still handles daily operations. Internal users already authenticate via Keycloak for new apps. Cultural shift (new login, new UX) is done. Adding modules is now just development work.

## Architecture Principles (CLARITY)

Codified decisions in `obito-backend/docs/rules/`:

- **C**ompose, don't modify (Decorator/Strategy/Builder)
- **L**ayer purity (Presentation → Application → Domain → Infrastructure)
- **A**rchitectural performance (cache/index placement)
- **R**epresent intent (Parameter Objects, Value Objects)
- **I**nput is guarded (validation at boundaries)
- **T**elemetry first (metrics, logs everywhere)
- **Y**ield safe failure (feature flags, graceful degradation)

## Origin Story

Started programming autodidactically with Paul Graham's "ANSI Common Lisp". Lisp dialects became of interest. Found Clojure as the industry-standard Lisp. Family has funeral home. Combined both.
