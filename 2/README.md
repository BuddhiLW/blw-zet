# Makes Sense

I told a friend of mine about KEG, and explained the best I could. One
of the points I pointed out was the democratization of participation on
the web. She is not a technical person, but could understand how cool it
would be to be able to participate on the web. That is, she also,
implicitly confessed that she doesn't feel participative on the current
web.
