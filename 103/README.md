# Training Periodization

Types of energy systems in the body:
- Phosphagen system (creatine-phosphate system) ;
- Glycolytic system;
- Aerobic pathway.

As a general rule, high-intensity and maximal training rely more on 
anaerobic metabolism, whereas lower-intensity and longer-duration 
training rely more on aerobic metabolism.

## Phosphagen System

```quote
The phosphagen system, also known as the phosphocreatine
or creatine phosphate system, is an anaerobic (without oxygen)
pathway that supplies immediate energy to your working muscles.
The amount of phosphocreatine stored in your body is limited, so
this system only provides you enough energy for about 10 seconds
of high-intensity exercise. Many sprint and explosive power ath-
letes utilize this system. After the initial 10 seconds of this type of
training, athletes typically require about 2–4 minutes of rest to
allow regeneration of the phosphocreatine used.

## Glycolytic system

```quote
As with the first energy system, the
glycolytic system also has limited stores and provides only
enough fuel for about 1–2 minutes of high-intensity exercise.
This system also yields lactate molecules, which can be thought
of as friends rather than foes. Lactate can be used as an energy
source to fuel your muscles at certain intensity levels.

## Aerobic pathway

```quote
he third energy system, aerobic energy, uses oxygen to pro-
vide energy and can thus produce a larger amount of energy.
Pyruvate, a product of glycolysis, enters the mitochondria (the
energy factories of the cell) and generates a constant supply of
energy to fuel working muscles for hours and hours.
