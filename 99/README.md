# Market strategies and signals

When modeling signals of entry, in up-trending markets, it's common that we get either too early trend moments or end of trending moments, as well as the tip of the local high as a signal.

What we want is to delay the entry, so we have confirmation and we buy only in pull-back moments.

This way, we maximize profits and lower risks as well as off the bat, once the market moves, we have a clear indication of profit or drawdown in this trade.

One strategy that would be perfect is [`ichv`](https://www.freqst.com/strategy/0e1e73046f96bb72d955553b1fd5420aa4de5bf2cc43a3bb25ec037de9688ffd38adfef89d2c0/). But, it uses future data that we don't have. Either way, it's practical problem becomes that signals happen naturally delayed, although, they do indicate trending moments pretty accurately. 

One way to adapt this strategy is to either enter the signals after the pullback, or estimate the next candle with A.I.
