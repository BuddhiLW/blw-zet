## Wikipedia edits

``` quote
I tried to add background information on the reception section, from Abby Martin - which knowingly has been target by [https://mediaroots.org/abby-martin-responds-to-attacks-from-pro-israel-organizations/ smear campaign] from Jewish organizations, think-tanks and the Jewish american lobby. And it was promptly reverted by "Steven Homan", [[Special:Contributions/Steven Homan|which only has contentious edits to Jewish-related pages like Hanukkah and Blood libel]] and [[User talk:Steven Homan#August 2024|Einstein (which someone had the same issue of him reverting edits frequently, in order to fit his views)]].

Since, all negative receptions in this page were done either by American Jews, or columnists to famously [https://www.tabletmag.com/sections/israel-middle-east/articles/sorry-there-is-no-two-state-solution pro-Israelli occupation of Palestine], like the Tablet - self titled a [https://www.tabletmag.com/about "Jewish magazine about the world"]. Therefore, '''my edit was in order to highly where the information was coming from''' (from who, and what is their background), '''in relation to Abby Martin. Which is''' '''extremely relevant'''. 

Let's imagine, a random viewer of this page would look at "Reception" and see a ratio of 5 blatant personal insults to 1 praise of her work. At face value, there is only reception. But, if added their nationality and where they work, the viewer can arrive at his own conclusion if the pattern of all these insults coming from Jewish personnel or Jewish Journal's employees is or is not relevant when accessing the validity of the reception.

In pages like [[Reception of WikiLeaks|Wikileaks Reception]], we can see division by nationality. Since, it was a globally important journalist work, with ramifications for different countries. And, it is considered a '''relevant piece of information - where it's coming from'''. '''The same way,''' can be said, from comments coming from pro-Israelli, mostly zionist, journalists; since Abby's work on Palestine, which clearly upset people like James Kirchick an American Jewish journalist working for the Haaretz, which openly thinks [https://www.latimes.com/opinion/op-ed/la-oe-kirchick-israel-palestinian-conflict-20190524-story.html any journalist covering this issue should be classified as a "''polemicistst"'']. Clearly, he thinks there is nothing to see there.

So, '''I'm not trying to blatantly call a smear campaign''' in this section for what it is: a smear campaign. I only put out ''these'' edits:

- "<nowiki>[[James Kirchick]]</nowiki>, '''an American Jewish journalist and contributor to <nowiki>''</nowiki><nowiki>[[Haaretz]]</nowiki><nowiki>''</nowiki>, commented'''";

- "Journalist <nowiki>[[Michael C. Moynihan]]</nowiki>, '''a contributor to <nowiki>''</nowiki><nowiki>[[Tablet Magazine]]</nowiki><nowiki>''</nowiki>, which describes him as an "obsessive-compulsive observer of Jewish affairs" in his column titled <nowiki>''</nowiki>The Righteous Gentile<nowiki>''</nowiki>'''";

- "Author and media consultant <nowiki>[[Chez Pazienza]]</nowiki>''', writing for <nowiki>''</nowiki>The Daily Banter<nowiki>''</nowiki>, an outlet founded by <nowiki>[[Ben Cohen (journalist)|Ben Cohen]]</nowiki>, a British Jewish based in Washington, D.C.'''";

- "'''American Jewish''' journalist and author <nowiki>[[John Stossel]]</nowiki> states (...)";

In the same spirit, it is already a part of the page that "[[David Cromwell]], British media campaigner of and co-editor of ''[[Media Lens]]'' (...)" says so and so. Suddenly, when it's a praise to her work, it's important to note this is a British media campaigner for the Media Lens. But, not that James Kirchick is a columnist to the Haaretz; is a American Jew; and has dismissed any work on the occupation of Palestine as "polemicism". Or the "Righteous Gentile, the obsessive-compulsive observer of Jewish affairs" ([https://www.tabletmag.com/sections/news/articles/michael-moynihan-joins-tablet-as-columnist not my words]).

Something is very fishy here.
