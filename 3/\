A novel extremely intricate in it's _Motives_, which is the
combined result of the _Act, Scene, Agent, Agency and Purpouse_[^1], as

Each character has it's own **Purpouse**, and the ratio of their
Agent-Purpouse brings all their background forward. Even secondary
characters, like GÃ¡nia's henchman
