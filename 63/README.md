# Ascension of Bahá’u’lláh - what Emacs can tech you

```quote
It is by the fortune of God that, in this country, we have three benefits:
freedom of speech, freedom of thought, and the wisdom never to use either.
                -- Mark Twain
```

```quote
If the learned and worldly-wise men of this age were to allow mankind to inhale the fragrance
of fellowship and love, every understanding heart would apprehend the meaning of true liberty,
and discover the secret of undisturbed peace and absolute composure.

   – Bahá’u’lláh –

One of the most interesting things about Emacs agendas are the holiday dates. It seems the org-agenda is populated with a lot of religions and solar/lunar dates[^1].

One I never heard before, and therefore I read about, whas Bahai's religion. A contemporany religion with fresh origins - their Messiah was born in 1817[^2].

"31.13.2 Customizing the Holidays

   There are several variables listing the default holidays that Emacs knows about. These
   are: holiday-general-holidays, holiday-local-holidays, holiday-solar-holidays,
   holiday-bahai-holidays, holiday-christian-holidays, holiday-hebrew-holidays,
   holiday-islamic-holidays, holiday-oriental-holidays, and holiday-other-holidays. The
   names should be self-explanatory; e.g., holiday-solar-holidays lists sun- and
   moon-related holidays."
