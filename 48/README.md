# Payment in software companies

I currently work on a company, for which I developed, in three months, a software that is supposed to be developed in 7+ months and with the hands of 2.45 people. That is, this is the estimation of `scc`[^1].

The project itself got more than 6.000 on cyclomatic complexity! (much because the company enforces you to either use **Vanilla JavaScript**, or **Jquery**. All because of "if you use any other thing, I can't replace you instantly" reasons.

Well, turns out that the estimated development cost (what you pay for the developers etc.) should be of one million Reais *(R$)* - equivalent two hundred thousand dollars (2023). But, the company only employed me, a supposed-to-be Junior. And, these fuckers pay me only 4200 Reais (less than a thousand dollars a month).

Well, that means that I get payed 7.54% of the use-value I produce.
